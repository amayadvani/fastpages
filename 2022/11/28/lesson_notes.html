<p><strong>Essential Knowledge</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A variable is an abstraction that stores a value inside of a program, and each variable has a corresponding data storage that only ever stores one value at a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most variables have meaningful names that aid in the general structure of the code and the comprehension of what the variables are meant to represent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Variables like Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) are used to refer to data that is represented in a variety of ways by some programming languages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Variable</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An abstraction created within a program that stores a value is known as a variable. These variables help structure the computer code and make it operate more smoothly since they are utilized in the code to refer to more complex values that the variable holds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data Types</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>integers (number)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>string (text)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>boolean (true/false)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lists</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The elements within the list can be accessed by index</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can store various elements</p>

<p><strong>Lesson 3.3.1</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A sequence is the order in which something should be done in order to reach a goal, much as how you would follow a teacher’s directions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your car runs out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill it up, but if your car is full, you wouldn’t go to the gas station. A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on whether a condition is met.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iterations make allows an algorithm to make a decision in code</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lesson 3.4</strong></p>

<p>String :</p>

<p>Characters in sequential order</p>

<p>There may be some processes that can be applied to strings.</p>

<p>Every language has its own conventions, techniques, and capabilities.</p>

<p>Remainder:</p>

<p>The order of operations for division and multiplication is the same for operators with MOD. The syntax of MOD in Python and the majority of computer languages is %</p>

<p><strong>Lesson 3.5</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a Boolean is a denoting a system of algebraic notation used to represent logical propositions, especially in computing and electronics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Testing if two numbers or variables are equal is a common example.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Relational Operators</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>NOT, it displays the opposite of whatever the data is. Mainly used for true/false, and does not effect the variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AND, used to evaluate two conditions together and determine if both conditions are met</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OR, when using or the function only looks to see if one of the conditions is met then will</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lesson 3.7</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can be used for a varying amount of “else if statements.” The first if statement can represent if two conditions are true. The first else if can represent if only one or the other is true. The last else if represents if neither of the conditions are true.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>List procedures are implemented in accordance with the syntax rules of the programming language</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lesson 3.10.1</strong></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This ensures that it is sequenced correctly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm</p>

<h2 id="unit-2-binarydata-terms">Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms</h2>
<p>Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles:</p>

<p>One byte is equivalent to eight bits.</p>

<p>Nibble: four consecutive binary digits or half of an 8-bit byte.</p>

<p>Hexadecimal: A byte (or octet) is 8 bits so is always represented by 2 Hex characters in the range 00 to FF.</p>

<p>Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point</p>

<p>Unsigned Integer: ust like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don’t have a + or - sign associated with them.</p>

<p>signed integer: A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range</p>

<p>Floating point: A number type that may represent decimal values is a floating point number. It is stored in a particular format in a computer’s memory and is composed of a mantissa and an exponent.</p>

<p>Boolean: A boolean is a type of data that only has the options of true or false. In programming, it is frequently used to indicate the result of a comparison or logical process.</p>

<p>ASCII: The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a convention for how characters are represented in computers. Each numerical value that it uses to represent a character is associated with a particular character.</p>

<p>Unicode is a standard for how characters are displayed on computers. Despite having a far larger variety of characters than ASCII and being able to represent characters from several languages and scripts, it is comparable to ASCII.
RGB: The color model RGB (Red Green Blue) is utilized in computer graphics and digital photography. By blending various red, green, and blue light intensities, it simulates color.</p>

<p>Lossy: A method of data compression called lossy involves throwing away some of the data in order to make the data smaller. The quality may suffer as a result, but the data may become more manageable and straightforward to send.</p>

<p>Data compression that doesn’t cause any data loss is known as lossless data compression. It functions by figuring out methods to more effectively portray the data without erasing any of the original data.</p>

<p>Programming terms for designated storage areas that may store values are variables. A variable’s value can be altered while a program is running.</p>

<p>Data types are a way for programmers to categorize data according to the kind of value that it can store. Integers, floating point numbers, strings, and booleans are examples of common data types.</p>

<p>Assignment operator: In programming, an assignment operator is a symbol that is used to give a variable a value. The equal symbol (=) is used as the assignment operator in Python.</p>

<p>Lists: A list is an ordered collection of values in programming. Any data type may be stored in a list, and its indices can be used to access those items (the position of the value in the list).</p>

<p>Lists that include other lists are referred to as 2D lists.</p>
