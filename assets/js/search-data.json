Stay Fresh . . We developed our slogan “Stay Fresh” through brainstorming appropriate and new ideas that will be best fitting, and gender neutral. Our new slogan is consistent and is memorable, while using short, attractive words to describe our clients’ product. Our slogan is authentic by being honest when using our slogan. Our targeted audience are teens and young adults, so by advertising our product to people who need it, it keeps the product and slogan relevant. Along with all of that, our slogan also hits our targeted audience. Our product is mostly for teenagers, and for young adults, our product is marketed for the group because deodorant, hair products, and body products, is for every growing man. . We decided to start with stay in our slogan because it induces confidence in the consumer because it states that the viewer is already fresh, due to the infinitive present participle tense of the word stay. Secondly, the word fresh is a short and sweet descriptive word that keeps our product authentic and honest. Together, the words stay and fresh are short, memorable, and stays true to our clients product and business. . Our Canva Poster uses red throughout and images from the Old Spice company to stay consistent using their logos and colors. In addition, it includes products and the link to their website. .",

Lady Liberty represents hope through embracing opportunity for those looking for a better life in America, while extending a warm welcome to millions of immigrants. The Statue of Liberty also honors France’s alliance with the United States during the American Revolution and symbolizes goodwill .The statue was initially intended to serve as a symbol of the camaraderie and shared love of liberty between the people of France and the United States, but it has evolved into much more. Lastly, the torch is a representation of enlightenment. It is intended to illuminate the route to freedom and direct us toward the direction of justice and liberty. There was even a suggestion that the monument might really light the path for sailors entering New York Harbor at one point. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .
