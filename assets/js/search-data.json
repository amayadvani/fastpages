            "content": "Code.org Link . Link for App Lab Quiz . Intial Thoughts . At first when I heard about this assignment I wanted to start with the code right away, although, I soon realized that I would have to make my design first to define all my needed variables . Design . I choose the preset theme, glow in the dark, because I wanted to make my quiz unique. . Although when I started dragging buttons and text-boxes i ran into issues defining buttons because I would define the same button to do two different things at different places in the code. I had to rethink my design and how I would generally go about the creation of the quiz. . Before, whether the user would see another screen when clicking the right or wrong answer, then switch to the next question. But, there would be the same button would be defined multiple times. . To fix this problem, instead of making the code switch to another screen to indicate whether the right or wrong answer was given, I added a label and made the label display correct or incorrect. . Code . For the code of this website was originally on block code, but I changed mine to regular javascript, because it is easier to work with and define variables and run code. In addition, I added a percentage checker so that after you take the test, it will show how many u got right. Everything the user picks the correct answer, the a variable is had one added onto it. . 1) First I defined the variables a and q to define the # of answers correct and # of questions in total. . var q = 3; var a = 0; . 2) Second I added a function that asks the user if they are ready to take the quiz or not. If they clicked yes, the screen would change to the first questions. But if the user clicked no, then they would be taken to separate screen just to say, &quot;Seems like you aren&#39;t ready for the python quiz&quot;. . onEvent(&quot;button1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen2&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen7&quot;); }); . 3) After these two steps, the rest of the code is mostly the same due to repetitive button clicking and screen switching. Whenever the user would click the wrong answer, a textbox would display words saying, &quot;Incorrect&quot;, but when they clicked the right one, it would display, &quot;Correct&quot;. THe user has the choice to skip and go to the next question at anytime via radio button. . onEvent(&quot;button16&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setText(&quot;label3&quot;, &quot;INCORRECT&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button14&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setText(&quot;label3&quot;, &quot;INCORRECT&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button15&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { a = a+1 ; setText(&quot;label3&quot;, &quot;CORRECT!&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button17&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setText(&quot;label3&quot;, &quot;INCORRECT&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;radio_button3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen4&quot;); }); . 4) After the end of the quiz, I switched the screen to the final screen and calculated the percentage just by dividing the a and q variables defined in the first steps. . onEvent(&quot;radio_button4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen8&quot;); }); var x = a/q ; setText(&quot;label5&quot;, &quot;Good job you scored a&quot;+ x +&quot;3!&quot;); . Extra Python quiz . To show my interest and expertise in this topic, I creates another quiz off python in my notebook. . Here is the link .",

            "content": ". Overview . I took this test on friday, november fourth. The main things that I didn’t get were the big logic functions, binary code, and transmission of information through the internet. . Wrong questions . Q16 How information is transmitted on the Internet: . Q: Which of the following best explains how messages are typically transmitted over the Internet? . A: The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device. . The answer that I put was : The message is broken into packets that are transmitted in a specified order. Each packet must be received in the order it was sent for the message to be correctly reassembled by the recipient’s device. This answer is Incorrect because messages are broken into packets, but they can be received in any order and still be reassembled. . Q18 Relationship between Internet and World Wide Web . Q : Which of the following best describes the relationship between the World Wide Web and the Internet? . A : C The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet. . The answer that I put was : A, The World Wide Web is a protocol that is accessed using a data stream called the Internet. This answer is Incorrect because the World Wide Web is not a protocol, and the Internet is not a data stream. . Things I had to search up . The main things I had problems with were the binary questions. In this class we never really went over how to read or decipher binary numbers like 1 and 0, so figuring out binary code was hard. At first I just searched up what the combinations of 1 and 0 represented, but after I realized I made no sense without knowing how to actually calculate with binary so I searched up how to actually do it. Reading binary is related to the power of 2^x + 2^x an if there is a zero, there nothing in that power line. . In addition, I had to search up come questions about the world wide web connections and how they send information through out the world. The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet. Additionally, it send message after it is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device. .",

            "content": "Collaboration Notes . The first questions shows the benefits of assembling a diverse team, are that collaboration that includes diverse backgrounds and perspectives can eliminate the need for software testing. . The second question was how to Facilitate collaboration between group members. The best option was Having all three students write code independently and then having one student combine the code into a program. . The third question was about User participation in software development. While the benefit of having multiple users participate are that Users can provide feedback that can be used to incorporate a variety of perspectives into the software. . Identifying and correcting errors . The first question reviewed errors in if/else statement. The answer was to interchange lines 3 and 7 because you had to set the score as a variable before you use it, cause then nothing would happen. . The second question asked which of the following did not return the intended result while testing cases for a list. I didn’t really know how to answer this one, so I just looked at the pattern that all of them had, and that [ -1,0,1 ], was out of the ordinary, because it was the only list with both positive and negative values. . The third question shows an if statement inside of an if statement. It was asking if all three grades were being represented equally, and in the if statement, there was nothing about getting a grade below 7, like 6, or getting 8. As a result, I decided to click on those options. . Program and Development Quiz . 1) Documentation for procedure with a loop, showing a procedure to print nums to max, where max is a positive integer. The question was basically asking what the loop was doing, and it was printing all the positive odd integers that are less then or equal to max. . 2) Documentation for procedure with additions and division. The procedure displays the value of (x+y)/x while the value of the parameter x must not be 0. . 3) Documentation for procedure with lists. The procedure displays a swap list elements function that returns a copy of numlist with the elements at indices j and k interchanged. The values of j and k must both be between 1 and length(numlist), inclusive. . Internet Quiz . 1) How information is transmitted on the Internet The question was : Which of the following best explains how messages are typically transmitted over the Internet? I answered: The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device. I chose this option because it made the most sense for information to be broken up to be transmitted. I was correct. . 2) Purpose of Internet protocols The question was : Which of the following is a primary reason for the use of open protocols on the Internet? I answered : Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices. I chose this option because it had information from the previous question which tells me that this was the right answer. . 3) Relationship between Internet and World Wide Web The question was : Which of the following best describes the relationship between the World Wide Web and the Internet? I answered : The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet. I chose this option because the world web is a system of linked webpages. I was correct. .",

. Hacks . Find and use an API as part of your project. An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

Challenge . This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation. . What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99, &quot;milkshake&quot;: 2.99} kb = 3.99 kf = 1.99 kd = 0.99 km = 2.99 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) if item == &quot;burger&quot;: print(&quot;$ 3.99&quot;) elif item == &quot;fries&quot;: print(&quot;$ 1.99&quot;) elif item == (&quot;drink&quot;): print(&quot;$ 0.99&quot;) elif item == &quot;milkshake&quot;: print(&quot;$ 2.99&quot;) else : print(&quot;Please input something on the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 milkshake $2.99 $ 2.99 . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | .",

All of these factors present chances for cooperation. The range of skills and viewpoints of people who created it are reflected in the computer innovation that results from effective cooperation. The software gains fresh ideas as a result of collaboration. Super Mario Brothers 2 is an updated version of Super Mario Bros. Where you went vertically in a level was something Kensuke Tanabe understood. Also include horizontal levels, according to Shigeru Miyamoto. Then, they worked together to merge both vertical and horizontal levels in Super Mario Brothers 3.Bias is less likely to be present when computer advances are developed through collaboration with a variety of viewpoints. This implies that new features and concepts that wouldn’t be seen alone are conceivable while working together. . Takeway: Communication, consensus-building, dispute resolution, and negotiation are all part of collaboration. . Collaboration Video 2 . Pair programming involves two programmers working together; the observer evaluates the observer’s code and provides assistance. Think-Pair-Share: Consider a topic on your own, discuss it with a partner, and then present it to a wider group. Commenting in code involves communicating with others and with oneself, acknowledging code and media from other sources, describing what each individual done, and elucidating the code. Working together in class using sites like Repl.it, GitHub, sharing documents or folders, and soliciting testers for your application. . Takeaway: Talk to users to get a variety of suggestions and figure out how to make the application more user-friendly. .",

            "content": "Code.org Link . Link for App Lab Quiz . Intial Thoughts . At first when I heard about this assignment I wanted to start with the code right away, although, I soon realized that I would have to make my design first to define all my needed variables . Design . I choose the preset theme, glow in the dark, because I wanted to make my quiz unique. . Although when I started dragging buttons and text-boxes i ran into issues defining buttons because I would define the same button to do two different things at different places in the code. I had to rethink my design and how I would generally go about the creation of the quiz. . Before, whether the user would see another screen when clicking the right or wrong answer, then switch to the next question. But, there would be the same button would be defined multiple times. . To fix this problem, instead of making the code switch to another screen to indicate whether the right or wrong answer was given, I added a label and made the label display correct or incorrect. . Code . For the code of this website was originally on block code, but I changed mine to regular javascript, because it is easier to work with and define variables and run code. In addition, I added a percentage checker so that after you take the test, it will show how many u got right. Everything the user picks the correct answer, the a variable is had one added onto it. . 1) First I defined the variables a and q to define the # of answers correct and # of questions in total. . var q = 3; var a = 0; . 2) Second I added a function that asks the user if they are ready to take the quiz or not. If they clicked yes, the screen would change to the first questions. But if the user clicked no, then they would be taken to separate screen just to say, &quot;Seems like you aren&#39;t ready for the python quiz&quot;. . onEvent(&quot;button1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen2&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen7&quot;); }); . 3) After these two steps, the rest of the code is mostly the same due to repetitive button clicking and screen switching. Whenever the user would click the wrong answer, a textbox would display words saying, &quot;Incorrect&quot;, but when they clicked the right one, it would display, &quot;Correct&quot;. THe user has the choice to skip and go to the next question at anytime via radio button. . onEvent(&quot;button16&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setText(&quot;label3&quot;, &quot;INCORRECT&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button14&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setText(&quot;label3&quot;, &quot;INCORRECT&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button15&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { a = a+1 ; setText(&quot;label3&quot;, &quot;CORRECT!&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button17&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setText(&quot;label3&quot;, &quot;INCORRECT&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;radio_button3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen4&quot;); }); . 4) After the end of the quiz, I switched the screen to the final screen and calculated the percentage just by dividing the a and q variables defined in the first steps. . onEvent(&quot;radio_button4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen8&quot;); }); var x = a/q ; setText(&quot;label5&quot;, &quot;Good job you scored a&quot;+ x +&quot;3!&quot;); .

Stay Fresh . . We developed our slogan “Stay Fresh” through brainstorming appropriate and new ideas that will be best fitting, and gender neutral. Our new slogan is consistent and is memorable, while using short, attractive words to describe our clients’ product. Our slogan is authentic by being honest when using our slogan. Our targeted audience are teens and young adults, so by advertising our product to people who need it, it keeps the product and slogan relevant. Along with all of that, our slogan also hits our targeted audience. Our product is mostly for teenagers, and for young adults, our product is marketed for the group because deodorant, hair products, and body products, is for every growing man. . We decided to start with stay in our slogan because it induces confidence in the consumer because it states that the viewer is already fresh, due to the infinitive present participle tense of the word stay. Secondly, the word fresh is a short and sweet descriptive word that keeps our product authentic and honest. Together, the words stay and fresh are short, memorable, and stays true to our clients product and business. . Our Canva Poster uses red throughout and images from the Old Spice company to stay consistent using their logos and colors. In addition, it includes products and the link to their website. .",
