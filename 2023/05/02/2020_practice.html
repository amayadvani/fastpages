<h2 id="q6-correctness-of-robot-programs">Q6 Correctness of robot programs</h2>
<p>1.D
0/1 MC pointIncorrect answer
The question below uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom left square of the grid and facing right.</p>

<p>The figure presents a robot in a grid of squares with 5 rows and 4 columns. The robot is represented by a triangle which is initially in the lower left square of the grid, facing right. The grid contains a gray square in the first row and third column of the grid.
The following programs are each intended to move the robot to the gray square. Program II uses the procedure GoalReached, which returns true if the robot is in the gray square and returns false otherwise.</p>

<p>The figure presents two programs, labeled Program 1 and Program 2. Program 1 has a block of code that consists of six lines. Throughout the code there are nested blocks of code. [Begin Block] Line 1: REPEAT 2 TIMES [Begin Block] Line 2: [begin block] MOVE_FORWARD [end block] Line 3: [begin block] ROTATE_LEFT [end block] Line 4: [begin block] MOVE_FORWARD [end block] Line 5: [begin block] MOVE_FORWARD [end block] Line 6: [begin block] ROTATE_RIGHT [end block] [End Block] [End Block]. Program 2 has a block of code that consists of 5 lines. Throughout the code there are nested blocks of code. [Begin Block] Line 1: REPEAT UNTIL [begin block] GoalReached [end block] [Begin Block] [Begin Block] Line 2: IF [begin block] CAN_MOVE [begin block] forward [end block] [end block] [Begin Block] Line 3:  [begin block] MOVE_FORWARD] [end block] [End Block] Line 4: ELSE [Begin Block] Line 5: [begin block] ROTATE_LEFT [end block] [End Block] [End Block] [End Block] [End Block]
Which of the following statements best describes the correctness of the programs?</p>

<p>A
Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square, but program II does not.</p>

<p>B
Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square, but program I does not.</p>

<p>C
Both program I and program II correctly move the robot to the gray square.</p>

<p>D
Neither program I nor program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square.</p>

<p>Answer A
Incorrect. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square.</p>

<h2 id="q65-calls-to-concat-and-substring">Q65 Calls to concat and substring</h2>
<p>4.B
0/1 MC pointIncorrect answer
A program contains the following procedures for string manipulation.</p>

<p>Procedure Call	Explanation
Concat (str1, str2)	Returns a single string consisting of str1 followed by str2. For example, Concat (“key”, “board”) returns “keyboard”.
Substring (str, start, length)	Returns a substring of consecutive characters from str, starting with the character at position start and containing length characters. The first character of str is located at position 1. For example, Substring (“delivery”, 3, 4) returns “live”.
Which of the following can be used to store the string “jackalope” in the string variable animal ?</p>

<p>Select two answers.</p>

<p>A
animal 
←
 Substring (“antelope”, 5, 4)</p>

<p>animal 
←
 Concat (animal, “a”)</p>

<p>animal 
←
 Concat (Substring (“jackrabbit”, 1, 4), animal)</p>

<p>B
animal 
←
 Substring (“antelope”, 5, 4)</p>

<p>animal 
←
 Concat (“a”, animal)</p>

<p>animal 
←
 Concat (Substring (“jackrabbit”, 1, 4), animal)</p>

<p>C
animal 
←
 Substring (“jackrabbit”, 1, 4)</p>

<p>animal 
←
 Concat (animal, “a”)</p>

<p>animal 
←
 Concat (animal, Substring (“antelope”, 5, 4))</p>

<p>D
animal 
←
 Substring (“jackrabbit”, 1, 4)</p>

<p>animal 
←
 Concat (animal, “a”)</p>

<p>animal 
←
 Concat (Substring (“antelope”, 5, 4), animal)</p>

<p>Answer A
Incorrect. This code segment stores the substring “lope” in animal. It then concatenates “lope” and “a”, storing the result “lopea” in animal. Lastly, it concatenates the substring “jack” and “lopea”, storing the result “jacklopea” in animal.</p>
