<h2 id="q22-two-robots-in-separate-grids-try-to-reach-the-goal">Q22 Two robots in separate grids try to reach the goal</h2>

<p>Wrong: Neither grid I nor grid II</p>

<p>Right: Grid 1 only</p>

<h2 id="q41-using-binary-search-on-list-of-genetic-codes">Q41 Using binary search on list of genetic codes</h2>

<p>Wrong: The genetic codes must be converted from binary to decimal numbers.</p>

<p>Right: The list must be sorted based on the genetic code values.</p>

<h2 id="q45-benefits-of-procedural-abstraction">Q45 Benefits of procedural abstraction</h2>

<p>Wrong: Procedural abstraction eliminates the need for programmers to document their code.</p>

<p>Right: Procedural abstraction provides an opportunity to give a name to a block of code that describes the purpose of the code block.</p>

<h2 id="q49-crowd-flow-simulation">Q49 Crowd flow simulation</h2>

<p>Wrong: The model used by the simulation software cannot be modified once the simulation has been used.</p>

<p>Right: The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>1) Initial values refer to the starting point or seed values used in a computation or algorithm, such as in optimization problems or machine learning models. If the initial values used in a computation or algorithm yield an incorrect value of the maximum, it could be due to a number of factors.</p>

<p>2) A database of laptops: This would include information such as the make, model, and serial number of each laptop, as well as its current status. A system for check-out and check-in: This would allow students or staff to borrow laptops, and to return them when they are finished. The system would likely involve a check-out form, where the borrower would enter their name, ID, and other information, as well as the serial number of the laptop they are borrowing. When the laptop is returned, the borrower would enter the serial number again to check it back in.</p>

<p>3) a Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either true or false. A Boolean expression that checks if a variable “num” is greater than or equal to 15 can be written in several ways.</p>

<p>4) A code that checks if a person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote would likely involve comparing the person’s age to the legal driving age and the legal voting age.</p>

<p>5) A code that controls a robot navigating through a maze using a series of if-statements would likely involve checking the robot’s current position and the state of the surrounding squares in the maze.</p>
