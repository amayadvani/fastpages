<p>Reflection:</p>

<p>I believe my score is comparable to the CollegeBoard scores earned by these examples. I am reasonably knowledgeable about the requirements and what my project requires to be successful. My project must be comprehensive and feature a range of functionalities and abstraction in order to meet all needs. Lack of explanation of how something works in sufficient depth was one of the most obvious reasons a contribution would not have satisfied the standards in one area. Iâ€™ll remember that and make sure to provide as much information as possible to demonstrate how my project satisfies the guidelines.</p>
