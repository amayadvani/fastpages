    "1. DNS stands for Domain Name System.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The purpose of DNS is to translate human-readable domain names, such as google.com, into IP addresses that computers can understand. DNS allows users to access websites and other network resources by using memorable domain names instead of having to remember the IP addresses of every resource they want to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When a user types a domain name into their browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS resolver to obtain the IP address associated with that domain name. The resolver then queries the DNS hierarchy, starting with the root servers, to obtain the IP address for the requested domain name. The IP address is then returned to the resolver, which in turn returns it to the user's browser. The browser can then use the IP address to establish a connection to the desired resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A DNS resolver is a component of the DNS system that is responsible for resolving domain names into IP addresses. Resolvers can be configured on individual computers or on network servers. When a resolver receives a request for a domain name, it queries the DNS hierarchy to obtain the IP address associated with that name. Resolvers cache the results of previous queries to improve performance and reduce network traffic."

    "## Check In\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research 1 HTTP header and describe, in detail, its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of an HTTP header is the \"Content-Type\" header. The Content-Type header is used to indicate the media type of the resource that is being sent in the HTTP response. For example, if you were sending an HTML file as the response to an HTTP request, you would include the \"Content-Type: text/html\" header in the response. This tells the browser that the resource being sent is an HTML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a line in a sample NGINX configuration that will add that specific header to the `/information` location\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "  add_header X-Custom-Header my-header-value;\n",
    "  #other configuration directives\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Explain the purpose of the load balancing performed by NGINX\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of load balancing performed by NGINX is to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or instances. This helps to improve the availability, scalability, and performance of web applications by ensuring that no single server becomes overloaded with traffic. NGINX uses different load balancing algorithms to determine how to distribute traffic, such as round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented in web browsers to restrict cross-origin HTTP requests that are initiated by web scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To implement CORS in your website, you need to configure your server to include specific headers in the response that indicate which origins are allowed to access your resources. The most important header is the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which specifies the domain(s) that are allowed to make requests to your server. You can also use other headers to allow specific HTTP methods or headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CORS is important for security reasons because it prevents unauthorized cross-site scripting attacks. By implementing CORS, you can restrict which domains can access your resources, which prevents attackers from accessing sensitive data or executing malicious scripts on your website. Additionally, CORS allows you to share resources between domains, which can be useful for web applications that require data from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. By understanding how to use CORS, you can make your websites more secure and prevent potential attacks. Additionally, if you are building web applications that require data from multiple sources, CORS can help you share resources between domains and improve the user experience. Finally, as web technology continues to evolve, it is likely that CORS will become an increasingly important security feature, so understanding how to use it will be beneficial for your future career as a web developer.\n",
