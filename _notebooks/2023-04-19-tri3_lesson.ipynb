    "In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the 'MPG' column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the 'MPG' column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently"

    "#### Summary/Goals of Lesson:\n",
    "One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players.\n",

    "NumPy and Pandas are two popular Python libraries that are commonly used in data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy stands for Numerical Python, and it is a library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis, and it provides efficient and fast operations on arrays that are crucial for numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a library built on top of NumPy, and it provides high-level data manipulation tools that are designed to work with structured or tabular data. Pandas provides a DataFrame data structure that is similar to a spreadsheet, which can be used to manipulate and analyze data in various ways. Pandas makes it easy to load, manipulate, and analyze data from a variety of sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy and Pandas have some differences in terms of their intended use and features. NumPy is primarily focused on numerical computations and array operations, while Pandas is designed to work with structured data, including reading and writing data in various formats, cleaning and transforming data, and performing aggregations and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure in Pandas that can hold data of different types in its columns. A DataFrame can be thought of as a spreadsheet or a SQL table, where each row corresponds to a record or an observation, and each column corresponds to a feature or a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common operations that can be performed using NumPy include mathematical operations on arrays, linear algebra operations, statistical operations, and array manipulation operations such as reshaping, slicing, and indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use NumPy for numerical computations and array operations, and Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis tasks, including loading data from different sources, cleaning data, selecting and filtering data, performing aggregations, and visualizing data."
