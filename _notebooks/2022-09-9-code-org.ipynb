Although when I started dragging buttons and text-boxes i ran into issues defining buttons because i would define the same button to do two different things at different places in the code. I had to rethink my design and how I would generally go about the creation of the quiz. Before, whether the user would see another screen when clicking the right or wrong answer, then switch to the next question. But, there would be the same button would be defined multiple times. TO fix this problem, instead of making the code switch to another screen to indicate whether the right or wrong answer was given, I added a label and made the label display correct or incorrect."
