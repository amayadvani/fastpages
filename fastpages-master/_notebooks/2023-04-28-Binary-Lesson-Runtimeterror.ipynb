    "4. Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because it eliminates half of the remaining items with each iteration, making the search time grow logarithmically with the number of items. In contrast, sequential search requires iterating through every item in the list until the target item is found, which makes the search time grow linearly with the number of items. As a result, binary search is much faster for large lists of items."
