# 5.1 and 5.2 Reflection

## 1) Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Benefits: 

Increased efficiency and organization through the use of task management tools, such as to-do lists and calendar apps, can help individuals and teams prioritize and complete tasks more effectively.

Collaboration tools, such as shared document platforms and project management software, can facilitate communication and coordination among team members, leading to more effective teamwork and productivity.

Time-tracking and productivity tracking tools can help individuals and teams monitor their performance and identify areas for improvement, ultimately leading to increased productivity and goal attainment.

Harmful: 

One bad thing about using tools to help you be more productive is that it can make you feel like you always have to be working, even when you're not at the office, and that can be really tiring and can make it hard for you to have a good balance between your work and personal life.
