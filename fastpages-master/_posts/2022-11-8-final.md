# Overview

I took this test on friday, november fourth. The main things that I didn't get were the big logic functions, binary code, and transmission of information through the internet. 

# Wrong questions

Q16 How information is transmitted on the Internet:

Q: Which of the following best explains how messages are typically transmitted over the Internet?

A: The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.

The answer that I put was :  The message is broken into packets that are transmitted in a specified order. Each packet must be received in the order it was sent for the message to be correctly reassembled by the recipient’s device. This answer is Incorrect because messages are broken into packets, but they can be received in any order and still be reassembled.


Q18 Relationship between Internet and World Wide Web

Q : Which of the following best describes the relationship between the World Wide Web and the Internet?

A :   C
The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet.

The answer that I put was : A, The World Wide Web is a protocol that is accessed using a data stream called the Internet. This answer is Incorrect because the World Wide Web is not a protocol, and the Internet is not a data stream.

# Things I had to search up

The main things I had problems with were the binary questions. In this class we never really went over how to read or decipher binary numbers like 1 and 0, so figuring out binary code was hard. At first I just searched up what the combinations of 1 and 0 represented, but after I realized I made no sense without knowing how to actually calculate with binary so I searched up how to actually do it. Reading binary is related to the power of 2^x + 2^x an if there is a zero, there nothing in that power line. 

In addition, I had to search up come questions about the world wide web connections and how they send information through out the world. The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet. Additionally, it send message after it is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.
