### PBL Grading

## First Grade 

| Category                | Score | CB Score | Comments |
|------------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1  | valid purpose  with good shown function  |
| Data Abstraction       | 0 | 0 | doesnt creates a list to show data abstraction     |
| Managing Complexity    | 0 | 0 | bad complexity     |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Doesnt develops procedure and functionality is described       |
| Algorithm Implementation| 1 | 1 | Describes so that it can be recreated.       |
| Testing                | 1 | 1 | Calls procedures and describes conditions      |
| Total                | 3/6 | 3/6 |    ->      |





## Second Grade 

| Category                | Score | CB Score | Comments |
|------------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1  | invalid purpose  with decent function  |
| Data Abstraction       | 1 | 1 | doesnt use a list to show data abstraction     |
| Managing Complexity    | 1 | 1 | horrible complexity     |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | doesnt develops procedure and functionality isnt described       |
| Algorithm Implementation| 1 | 1 | Describes so that it can be recreated.       |
| Testing                | 1 | 1 | Calls procedures and describes conditions      |
| Total                | 6/6 | 6/6 |    ->      |



## Third Grade 

| Category                | Score | CB Score | Comments |
|------------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1  | valid purpose  with decent function  |
| Data Abstraction       | 0 | 0 | no list to show data abstraction     |
| Managing Complexity    | 0 | 0 | decent complexity     |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Doesnt develops procedure and functionality is described       |
| Algorithm Implementation| 0 | 0 | Doesnt describe so that it can be recreated.       |
| Testing                | 0 | 0 | Calls procedures and describes conditions      |
| Total                | 1/6 | 1/6 |    ->      |




## Fourth Grade 

| Category                | Score | CB Score | Comments |
|------------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | shows the program in depth       |
| Data Abstraction       | 1 | 1 | unidentified code          |
| Managing Complexity    | 1 | 1 | explains code and abstraction needed for complexity         |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | describes functionality        |
| Algorithm Implementation| 1 | 1 | sequencing and selection   |
| Testing                | 0 | 0 | doesnt show multiple parameters       |
| Total             | 5/6 | 5/6 | ->      |


Reflection: 

I believe my score is comparable to the CollegeBoard scores earned by these examples. I am reasonably knowledgeable about the requirements and what my project requires to be successful. My project must be comprehensive and feature a range of functionalities and abstraction in order to meet all needs. Lack of explanation of how something works in sufficient depth was one of the most obvious reasons a contribution would not have satisfied the standards in one area. I'll remember that and make sure to provide as much information as possible to demonstrate how my project satisfies the guidelines.
