## Ideas

Online Learning Management System:
Create a web application that allows teachers to create and manage courses, and students to enroll in and take those courses. The application should include user authentication, a dashboard for each user, and features such as course creation, assignment submission, grading, and progress tracking. The project should use appropriate software development principles such as modular design, error handling, and documentation.

E-Commerce Website:
Create an e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add items to their shopping cart, and check out using a secure payment system. The website should include user authentication, a search bar for products, and product recommendations based on user behavior. The project should use appropriate software development principles such as database design, data validation, and responsive design for mobile devices.

Connect Four Game
Create a game similar to connect four either in python terminal, or using javascript/scss to animate pieces and fullfil college board requirements.

## Progress

I already have a working cpt project from last trimester:

This  notetaker program was made in VScode using JavaScript and html. Its purpose is to make it faster and easier for users for type out notes or drafts for different classes.
