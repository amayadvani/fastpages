**Essential Knowledge**

- A variable is an abstraction that stores a value inside of a program, and each variable has a corresponding data storage that only ever stores one value at a time.

- Most variables have meaningful names that aid in the general structure of the code and the comprehension of what the variables are meant to represent.

- Variables like Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) are used to refer to data that is represented in a variety of ways by some programming languages.

**Variable** 

- An abstraction created within a program that stores a value is known as a variable. These variables help structure the computer code and make it operate more smoothly since they are utilized in the code to refer to more complex values that the variable holds.

**Data Types**

- integers (number)

- string (text)

- boolean (true/false)

**Lists**

- The elements within the list can be accessed by index

- Can store various elements

- The list is in order

**Lesson 3.3.1**

- A sequence is the order in which something should be done in order to reach a goal, much as how you would follow a teacher's directions.

- If your car runs out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill it up, but if your car is full, you wouldn't go to the gas station. A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on whether a condition is met.

- iterations make allows an algorithm to make a decision in code

**Lesson 3.4**

String :

Characters in sequential order

There may be some processes that can be applied to strings.

Every language has its own conventions, techniques, and capabilities.

Remainder: 

The order of operations for division and multiplication is the same for operators with MOD. The syntax of MOD in Python and the majority of computer languages is %
