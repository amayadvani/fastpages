## Statue of Liberty

The Statue of Liberty most effectively conveys American identity because of its ability to represent hope, friendship and enlightenment. Lady Liberty represents hope through embracing opportunity for those looking for a better life in America, while extending a warm welcome to millions of immigrants. The Statue of Liberty also honors France's alliance with the United States during the American Revolution and symbolizes goodwill .The statue was initially intended to serve as a symbol of the camaraderie and shared love of liberty between the people of France and the United States, but it has evolved into much more. Lastly, the torch is a representation of enlightenment. It is intended to illuminate the route to freedom and direct us toward the direction of justice and liberty. There was even a suggestion that the monument might really light the path for sailors entering New York Harbor at one point.
