### PBL Grading

## Third Grade Hypothetical Marvel Fights 

| Category                | Score | CB Score | Comments |
|------------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0  | invalid purpose  with decent function  |
| Data Abstraction       | 1 | 1 | Creates a list to show data abstraction     |
| Managing Complexity    | 1 | 1 | decent complexity     |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Develops procedure and functionality is described       |
| Algorithm Implementation| 1 | 1 | Describes so that it can be recreated.       |
| Testing                | 1 | 1 | Calls procedures and describes conditions      |
| Total                | 5/6 | 5/6 |    ->      |

Reflection: 

1) Mediocre Explanation, no specification
2) Creates a list to show data abstraction 
3) decent complexity  
4) Develops procedure and functionality is described 
5) Describes so that it can be recreated.
6) Calls procedures and describes conditions 


## Fourth Grade Guess 8 letter word

| Category                | Score | CB Score | Comments |
|------------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | shows the program in depth       |
| Data Abstraction       | 0 | 0 | unidentified code          |
| Managing Complexity    | 0 | 0 | doesnt explain code and abstraction needed for complexity         |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | describes functionality        |
| Algorithm Implementation| 1 | 1 | sequencing and selection   |
| Testing                | 0 | 0 | doesnt show multiple parameters       |
| Total             | 3/6 | 3/6 | ->      |

Reflection: 

1) shows the program in depth
2) distinct code isnt identified and shows repsonses
3) ignores nessacary code and abstraction needed for complexity
4) describes functionality
5) sequencing and selection
6) hads, but doesnt show multiple parameters
