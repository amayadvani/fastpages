## First Grade

| Category                | Score | CB Score | Comments |
|------------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0  | Mediocre Explanation, no specification   |
| Data Abstraction       | 1 | 1 | Creates a list to show data abstraction     |
| Managing Complexity    | 0 | 0 | Low complexity     |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Develops procedure and functionality is described       |
| Algorithm Implementation| 1 | 1 | Describes so that it can be recreated.       |
| Testing                | 1 | 1 | Calls procedures and describes conditions      |
| Total                | 4/6 | 4/6 |    ->      |
