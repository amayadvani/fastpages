## Computer Bias Questions

1) facebook: people over 25
   tiktok: people under 25


I dont think that this fact is harmful, therfore, I dont believe that it should be corrected. It also is good business so, there is no need to stop it. 


1) Most virtual assistants have a represetation of female voices because the tend to proununcate their vowels, and make is easier for users to understand what the AI is saying. In a bias view, most people respond better to female voices due to maternities throughout history and each individuals life. In addition, it targets a wider demographic based on age, because younger users could feel more comfortable around that femine type of voice. 

2) Most google and youtube algorithms caters ads and more videos/searches based on your previous videos that you watched, or searchs that are related to things that you already searched. In addition, websites like Amazon market products that are related to things that you have previously bought, or viewed multiple times. 


## As Pairs

The owner of the computer does think that this mistake is intentional. My concluision is that  this software wasnt tested enought with people of darker skin tones, or minimal testing at all. I dont think this mistake would be harmful, although some people could get offended based on this persons response. Yes, I do think that this problem should be corrected. To fix this issue, I would do more testing with people who have a darker skin tone, and probably change the code of the software.

## Crowd Source Hacks

1) Google form would include all students in APCSP. 
2) Yes, we could incorparate data from crowd sources into our APIs. 
3) For my feature, we would get crowd sourcing data from people who go to our site and input data into my notebook. This inputed data would be recorded in an api and represents data through crowd sourcing.
